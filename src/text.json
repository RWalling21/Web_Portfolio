      "Name": "Google, CEO",
      "Description": "During my time as CEO of Google, I decided to take all of the convenient styles we had created and redo them, though it was a controversial choice I think it was the right one. Many projects that I started, Google Glass,Google Car, Loon, and Stadia all failed magnificently! This does not matter however because I made so much money harvesting your data. Projects like Golang, Dart, Material.io, and other good uses of googles time and money I had no part of."

      "Name": "Open AI, Senior Dev",
      "Description": "My time at Open AI was exciting! We set out to make a superintelligent AI that would destroy the world, and succeeded! Why have you never heard of it? A good question that I refuse to answer. Open AI taught me everything I needed to know about machine learning and how to kill it in a catastrophic breach of security. Let's hope that never happens again..."

      "Name": "Spotify, Ad Sales",
      "Description": "You know when you're listening to Spotify, and instead of playing you a song, you get a loud ad? That was me! My team and I decided to make the ad as jarring and loud as possible, and for it to play at the least convenient time for the user. I think we succeeded on that front, and I am so proud of what I was able to develop."

      "ShortSummary": "One of my first projects, helps grade students.",
      "LongSummary": "This project was created because I saw classmates that were working their absolute hardest but weren't finishing their work on time. I thought that there should be some sort of way to reward students for their hard work, after consulting with my instructor we decided that a web-based rubric using our school's evidence of learning standards was the way to go. This was one of my first projects, and I had only been coding for a couple of months. Just over one year ago I finalized this application, and am amazed at how much further I have come since.",
